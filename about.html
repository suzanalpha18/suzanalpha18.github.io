        <p> My name is Yesmeen and currently studying CSC106: Joy of Programming <br>
            I am currently studying at <em> the University of Rhode Island </em> and I am trying to get an Aquaculture major. I chose CSC106 because it helped complete one of my electives for my major<br>
     I hope to learn how to program my own games and drawing apps during this course and I hope to share this course experiences to others who are interested in programming. <br>
