   <h2> CSC106 Final Project: Deal or no deal<h2>
            
       <p> My final Project is a based on the famous television game show: Deal or No Deal.<br>
   Mark Bowen and I's final project is a game based on the famous television game series: Deal or no Deal. In the deal or no deal game, the player is trying to get 1 million dollars or earn the highest value of cash by the end of the game. In order to win, the player must either accept a deal from the bank or chose the highest cash value found in the last case you chose. <br> To begin the game, select the "Start Game" button. This will link the player to the actually gameplay , where you will have 23 button cases are displayed. When you click on one of these cases, the case will reveal a ramdomized amount of cash. Click on five of the 23 cases. When you will clicked on five cases, the scene will change to the bank offer scene. The bank will offer a specific cash value and you will have the choice of either selecting the "Deal" button or "No Deal" button. If you select the deal, you will be taken to the win scene. This will reveal the amount of cash recieved based on the bank's offer. If you select the "No Deal" button, the program will jump back to the game scene but the number of cases you can clicked decreases by 1. This process will continue until the "Deal" button is selected or there are only two cases left. If there are only two remaining cases, the scene will shift to a "choose a case scene" and you must click on the "choose a case" button. If you select a case, the scene will immediately change to the win scene. The cash value you recieve with be the cash in the last case you chose.<br> My final project answers are found here,  <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fFq4hFxx0y3F_n73N2tikljwVSwFpKgXgKSYAiZljk8/edit"> khattab_final document</a>. </p>
