        <p> My name is Yesmeen and currently studying CSC106: Joy of Programming. <br>
            I am currently studying at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uri.edu"> the University of Rhode Island </a> and I am trying to get an Aquaculture major. I chose CSC106 because it helped complete one of my electives for my major.<br>
     I hope to learn how to program my own games and drawing apps during this course and I hope to share this course experiences to others who are interested in programming. <br>
